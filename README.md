# Web-logs---access
Retrieve data from web logs that recorded access to different websites from different IP addresses and then find out which sites are so-called popular and which are less popular.

The goal of my project was to retrieve data from web logs that recorded access to different websites from different IP addresses and then find out which sites are so-called popular and which are less popular. And I tried to create a pivot table that shows the number of accesses from individual IP addresses to the given website.

Based on the analysis, I created two graphs that show the most popular and less popular pages. The entire project is written in Python and the Jupyter environment was used for processing. I randomly generated and modified the logs to make it work better.
